# Program and absolute paths 
This challenge requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{MzN-lOcXbqGehA5pTEwNSAJ0rZp.QX1QTN0wSOwEzNzEzW}'

```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MzN-lOcXbqGehA5pTEwNSAJ0rZp.QX1QTN0wSOwEzNzEzW}

```

## What I Learned
The path to the challenge directory is /challenge. The name of the  program in the file is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory.
Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run

## References
None.
