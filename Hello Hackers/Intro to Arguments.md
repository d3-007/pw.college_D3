```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ echo hello hackers !
hello hackers !
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4UOvn52Q23FVLkesslu3_9zvToi.QX3YjM1wSOwEzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
The shell or the command line actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.
We learn that the command echo can take multiple arguments at a single go
